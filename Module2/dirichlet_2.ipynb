    "# Dirichlet Conditions and Fourier Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dirichlet conditions are a set of sufficient conditions for a function to be representable by a Fourier series at a point. These conditions are important for understanding when and how a function can be transformed into the frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dirichlet Conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Absolute Integrability\n",
    "The function must be absolutely integrable over one period, meaning:\n",
    "$$\\int_{-T/2}^{T/2} |f(t)| dt < \\infty$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A sine wave is absolutely integrable over any period, while a function that approaches infinity (like $1/t$ near $t=0$) may not be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Finite Number of Discontinuities\n",
    "The function can only have a finite number of points where it jumps from one value to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A square wave has exactly two discontinuities per period (rising and falling edges), satisfying this condition. In contrast, functions like $\\sin(1/t)$ near $t=0$ have infinitely many discontinuities in any interval containing zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Finite Number of Extrema\n",
    "The function must have a finite number of maxima and minima within one period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** A triangle wave has exactly one maximum and one minimum per period. Functions with infinite oscillations like $t\\sin(1/t)$ near $t=0$ violate this condition.\n"
